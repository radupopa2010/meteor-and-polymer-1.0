## how to install meteor and polymer 1.0

#### I just want to use this very short post to tell other developers how I installed Polymer 1.0 and above with Meteor.

The reason for this post is because I wanted to install Polymer from: [atmospherejs.com](https://atmospherejs.com/packages/polymer) 
but I keept getting this error: _"polymer: Unable to find suitable version for polymer"_.

1. Inside the root folder of your meteor app create the meteor recomaded folder structure: /both, /client, /server, /public.
2. Inside /public folder follow the instruction to install. [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/start/getting-the-code.html) that can be found on the official web site.
3. Tip: use Bower.

And that's all folks :)
