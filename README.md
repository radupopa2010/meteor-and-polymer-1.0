how to install meteor and polymer 1.0

I just want to use this post to tell to other developers how I installed Polymer 1.0 and above with Meteor.

The reason for this post is because I wanted to install Polymer from : [atmospherejs.com](https://atmospherejs.com/packages/polymer) 
but I keept getting this error: _"polymer: Unable to find suitable version for polymer"_

1. Inside the root folder of your meteor app create the meteor recomaded folder structure: /both, /client, /public
2. Inside /public follow the instruction on the official polymer
